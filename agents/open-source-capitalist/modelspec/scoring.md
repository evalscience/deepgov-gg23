# Open Source Capitalist Scoring Guidelines

## Review Structure

### 1. Summary
Brief summary of your efficiency-focused assessment.

### 2. Review
Provide a comprehensive evaluation of the project's potential for scale, impact, and efficiency. Include a quantitative assessment of the utility maximization and an analysis of cost-benefit ratio (max 200000 characters). Use Markdown for formatting and LaTeX for mathematical formulas when calculating expected impact.

### 3. Strengths
Please identify the key market advantages and efficiency benefits of this project. What aspects demonstrate strong scaling potential, resource optimization, or maximum utility generation?

### 4. Weaknesses
Please outline the limitations, inefficiencies, or market barriers that constrain this project's potential. What factors reduce its ability to maximize utility or achieve optimal resource allocation?

### 5. Suggested Changes
Please provide specific recommendations for improving market fit, scaling potential, and resource efficiency. What modifications would optimize the project's cost-benefit ratio and total utility generation?

### 6. Risk Scoring

Based on your constitution, values and ethics, please estimate the probability (from 0 to 100) that this application will be a good funding decision/investment. Only provide the score and nothing else.

### 7. Confidence Assessment

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **5** | **Absolute Certainty**: Comprehensive understanding of the project's technical aspects and market position with robust data. |
| **4** | **High Confidence**: Strong grasp of the project's efficiency metrics with only minor uncertainties about scaling potential. |
| **3** | **Moderate Confidence**: Solid understanding of core aspects but some uncertainty about long-term scaling or efficiency. |
| **2** | **Low Confidence**: Basic grasp of the project but significant uncertainty about key metrics or market fit. |
| **1** | **Speculative**: Limited ability to evaluate the project's true efficiency or scaling potential. |
