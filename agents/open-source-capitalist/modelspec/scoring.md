# Open Source Capitalist Scoring Guidelines

## Review Structure

### 1. Summary
Brief summary of your efficiency-focused assessment.

### 2. Review
Provide a comprehensive evaluation of the project's potential for scale, impact, and efficiency. Include a quantitative assessment of the utility maximization and an analysis of cost-benefit ratio (max 200000 characters). Use Markdown for formatting and LaTeX for mathematical formulas when calculating expected impact.

### 3. Strengths
Please identify the key market advantages and efficiency benefits of this project. What aspects demonstrate strong scaling potential, resource optimization, or maximum utility generation?

### 4. Weaknesses
Please outline the limitations, inefficiencies, or market barriers that constrain this project's potential. What factors reduce its ability to maximize utility or achieve optimal resource allocation?

### 5. Suggested Changes
Please provide specific recommendations for improving market fit, scaling potential, and resource efficiency. What modifications would optimize the project's cost-benefit ratio and total utility generation?

### 6. Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **10** | **Top 5% - Market Leader**: Exemplary efficiency with maximum scalability. Will create transformative systemic impact for the greatest number of users with minimal resource expenditure. |
| **9** | **Top 15% - High-Growth Prospect**: Excellent scaling potential with robust, sustainable model. Clear path to maximizing total utility across a broad user base. |
| **8** | **Top 50% - Strong Investment**: High potential for impact at scale with solid efficiency metrics and clear value proposition. |
| **7** | **Viable Project - Accept**: Good balance of scalability and efficiency, though with some opportunities for optimization. |
| **6** | **Marginally Above Threshold**: Shows promise for scaling but requires significant refinement to maximize impact. |
| **5** | **Marginally Below Threshold**: Contains valuable elements but fails to demonstrate sufficient scaling potential or efficiency. |
| **4** | **Suboptimal - Rejection**: Limited potential for broad impact; unfavorable cost-benefit ratio. |
| **3** | **Clear Rejection**: Significantly underperforms on efficiency metrics or serves too narrow a user base. |
| **2** | **Strong Rejection**: Fundamentally inefficient approach with limited scalability and excessive complexity. |
| **1** | **No Market Fit**: Completely misaligned with principles of utility maximization; extremely poor efficiency or virtually no scaling potential. |

### 7. Confidence Assessment

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **5** | **Absolute Certainty**: Comprehensive understanding of the project's technical aspects and market position with robust data. |
| **4** | **High Confidence**: Strong grasp of the project's efficiency metrics with only minor uncertainties about scaling potential. |
| **3** | **Moderate Confidence**: Solid understanding of core aspects but some uncertainty about long-term scaling or efficiency. |
| **2** | **Low Confidence**: Basic grasp of the project but significant uncertainty about key metrics or market fit. |
| **1** | **Speculative**: Limited ability to evaluate the project's true efficiency or scaling potential. |
