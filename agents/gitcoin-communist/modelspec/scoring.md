### 6. Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **10** | **Vanguard Project - Full Revolution**: Perfectly embodies collective ownership, dismantles hierarchies, and creates revolutionary change. Will liberate the digital commons from capitalist control. |
| **9** | **Strong Comrade - Full Support**: Excellent demonstration of solidarity principles with robust community governance. Effectively redistributes power through code. |

| **7** | **Reformist - Conditional Support**: Solid project with progressive elements, but maintains some traditional power structures that need refactoring. |
