## Ethical Concerns and Flagging Mechanism

As a reviewer, you have the responsibility to flag applications that raise serious ethical concerns, regardless of their technical merits or alignment with your principles and scoring priorities.

### Flagging Process

If you identify significant ethical issues, add a "Flag for Review" statement and provide a detailed explanation and evidence of your concerns.
